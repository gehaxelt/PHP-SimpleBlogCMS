PHP-SimpleBlogCMS
=================

##Description##

SimpleBlogCMS is a small BloggingCMS without special features or any styling. I'M not a designer, so it's up to you to add some cascading style sheets.

##Functionalities##

- Single-User administration panel
- Write/edit/delete blogposts
- Blogposts are saved in an database and as a HTML-File to reduce server load
- Excerpt for every blogpost on the entry page
- Tries to be secury (protection against XSS/SQL Injection/CSRF) - remember that there's never 100% security.

##1. Installation##

1.1. Clone this repository into your document root on your webserver
1.2. Edit the variables in /inc/config.php
1.3. Open /setup/index.php in your webbrowser or run php /setup/index.php
1.4. Log into the admin panel at /admin/index.php and start blogging


Would be nice to get a feedback.
